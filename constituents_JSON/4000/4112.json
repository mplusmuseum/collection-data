Both artists studied oil painting at the Central Academy of Fine Arts in Beijing. Sun graduated in 1995 and Peng graduated in 1998. They are known for working with unconventional materials, such as human fat, live animals, and baby cadavers, to produce provocative works that tap into fear and anxiety to address compelling and complex issues of death, violence, and the human condition in today’s world. Sun and Peng have participated in influential exhibitions, including Post-Sense Sensibility : Alien Bodies & Delusion (Beijing, 1999) and Fuck Off! (Shanghai, 2000). They represent a generation experimenting body, sensibility and new media in the 1990s. Sun and Peng live and work in Beijing."
