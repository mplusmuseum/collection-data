        "en": "Xu Yihui (born 1964, Lianyungang, Jiangsu Province) is a sculptor who is known for producing hand-moulded porcelain works featuring red books, Mao Zedong, and garish flowerbeds. He uses bright colours and an aesthetic that is often associated with kitsch art of the mid-1990s. Xu is part of the post-Tiananmen generation, who employs so-called ‘bad taste’ to create ironic art as a commentary on blooming consumerism, the superficiality of art, and the meaninglessness of cultural reproduction and traditional signifiers in China during the 1990s. Xu lives and works in Beijing.",
        "zh-hant": "徐一暉（1964年生於江蘇省連雲港市）是一位雕塑家，手製陶瓷是其代表作。他經常以小紅書、毛澤東和艷麗的花壇為題材，並採用鮮艷色彩及1990年代中期的媚俗藝術美學進行創作。作為後天安門世代的一員，徐氏創造出一系列「壞品味」的諷刺藝術，批判日益膨脹的消費主義、膚淺的藝術，以及文化複製和傳統符號這些出現在1990年代中國的無意義現象。他現於北京生活及工作。"
