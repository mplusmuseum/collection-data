Chen was concerned with the rapid commercialisation and urbanisation of southern China that began in the 1990s, and how it impacted the residents’ daily lives and psychology.\r\r\nHe focused particularly on the passage of time, mass media, landscape, and sociopolitics of city life. After moving to Beijing in 2006, Chen began to create animations by combining ink painting with video art. He photographed individual ink paintings that depicted scenes of everyday\r\r\nlife, political protests, and historical incidents, and then sequenced them together into animations. Through ink, photography, and video, he explored the relationship between individual memories and objective records."
