A prominent performance artist and painter, Wei stood at the forefront of Chinese contemporary art in the 1980s and 1990s. He adopted a provocative approach to create works that confronted social and political issues, which were particularly inspiring to Beijing East Village artists such as Ma Liuming. In the 1990s, Wei returned to the root of painting and created a series of Political Pop works that used Chinese popular culture to express an individual artistic view at a time of rapid social change. Wei is a professor and the dean of Oil Painting Department ofHubei Institute of Fine Arts in Wuhan."
