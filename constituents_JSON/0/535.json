His practice is representative of a new generation of Chinese artists who have shifted away from the realm of sociopolitical commentary to the direct depiction of everyday life and urbanisation. Yang takes an introspective approach towards the study of material nature, focusing primarily on wood and combining it with ready-made concepts. His work casts a minimalist form and recalls the arte povera philosophy to establish a space for interaction between objects and viewers. He was a finalist for the Hugo Boss Asia Art Award for Emerging Asian Artists in 2015. Yang lives and works in Beijing."
