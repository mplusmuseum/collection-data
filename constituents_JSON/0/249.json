Lee is a graduate of the department of fine arts at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and is one of the earliest Fotanian artists. Trained as a painter, Lee’s early practice included hand-painted cloths that were used in performances and his own mundane daily activities. His practice has since expanded to include paintings on cardboards, videos, audio recordings, and site-specific installations. His work explores the process of creation rather than the final result. It’s grounded on the quiet intensity of the human condition under a specific environment, which can be poetic, fragile, emotional, subtle, dynamic, indirect, private, or public. In 2013, Lee was selected as a finalist for the Hugo Boss Asia Art Award. That same year, he also represented Hong Kong at the fifty-fifth Venice Biennale. Lee currently lives and works in Hong Kong and Taipei."
