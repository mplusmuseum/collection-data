After graduation, he immediately joined the fine art creation unit of Mao Zedong’s Liaoning Provincial Publicity Organisation in Liaoning Province, where he served as an official painter. Wu developed a national style that combined Western and Chinese traditions. This style highlighted the propagandic function of social realist art in its celebration of the contributions of ordinary people during the Cultural Revolution, as well as heroic characters and moments in Chinese history. Wu lives in Shenyang, Liaoning Province."
