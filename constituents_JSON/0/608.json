Zhou graduated from the College of Fine Arts at Shanghai University with a degree in painting in 1987. He works with a diverse range of medium, including painting, installation, and film. His works are infused with a clever mix of amusement, antagonism, and sincerity. Highly recognisable classical and historical images and pop culture references are key motifs in his work. These motifs act as an artistic agent to subvert and provoke a re-reading of the conventional conditions of the contemporary art world and the mechanisms of the global economy. Zhou works and lives in Shanghai."
