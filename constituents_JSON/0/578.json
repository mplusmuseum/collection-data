As an artist, Zhang steered avant-garde experimentation in Shanghai in the 1980s. He was known for producing abstract, black-and-white works using mixed media to address notions of existence, humanity, and nature. After moving to New York in 1989, his works began to reflect the rapid transformation of China’s urban landscape and culture, and also questioned the meaning of value and authenticity. Zhang currently lives and works in Shanghai."
