Wang was born in Runan, Henan Province, and joined the propaganda department of the People’s Liberation Army as an oil painter and photographer between 1948 and 1950. This background paved the way for him to work as a photojournalist for newspapers in Henan in 1956. For the next thirty years, Wang travelled through Central China to document political, economic, and social transformations during the Mao period. He was widely recognised as a Native Soil Art artist whose work captures the life of ordinary, everyday heroes in the countryside."
