            "en": "The Northern Art Collective was active in the late 1980s. It was established in 1984 in Harbin, Heilongjiang, by a group of artists including Wang Guangyi, Shu Qun, and Ren Jian. Rather than focusing on formalism and aesthetics— aspects praised by academia at the time—the collective was interested in bringing forward the spiritual notion of the sublime and rationality in their works, which were marked by cold colour tone and abstract compositions.",
