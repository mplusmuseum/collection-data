The lines resemble waves and mountain ranges. At the bottom, a poem is inscribed in Chinese characters, in sparsely sprinkled dashes of strokes. Part of it reads, ‘Sea water waving and waving uninterrupted… only forming shapes and shapes floating and submerging… That ephemeral… that ephemeral… that ephemeral… that ephemeral…’."
