Shot in Kaohsiung in one day and with no script, the film was inspired by the migrant workforce in Taiwan, which is largely comprised of Southeast Asians from Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam, and their favoured gathering spot in the city: an abandoned floating seafood restaurant docked by the sea. Financed by a Taiwanese businessman in the mid- 1990s, the restaurant was built in Hong Kong and then transported by sea to Kaohsiung, where it operated from a prominent spot in the harbour until its closure."
