Hung first invited his father and acclaimed landscape painter Hung Hoi to paint a large rock, a symbol of endurance and solidity, with brush and cinnabar on paper, creating an integrated representation of classical authority; he then put two layers of paper on and underneath it, dampened them and traced the revealed cinnabar contours with a black fountain pen. As both sets of ink seeped through the paper, the steady red lines and bouncing black dots unevenly duplicated and overlapped, embodying the shifting power relations between father and son,tutor and pupil."
