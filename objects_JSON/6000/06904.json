The spacesuit is unusual in many ways: the torso looks like a naked, hairy chest, one of the feet is shaped like a two-toed hoof and the other like a metal shoe, one of the person’s hands has three fingers and the other looks like a pair of scissors, and two smoking pillars stick out of the round helmet. A large variety of fantastic creatures float around in the space around the person, including a octopus-like creature with three eyes and a three-legged robot with human eyes peering out of a narrow box and a long neck."
