Later, in the mid-1960s, pursuing his career in Paris, he created his unique intaglio prints based on the multi-colour technique of viscosity printing. The two watercolour works on display were made during this period: Formation presents exquisite and intricate lines and superposed colours, while Untitled uses blocks of black to cover over colourful lines in an attempt to explore basic forms, colours, and brushstrokes. Both works place an emphasis on the direct relationship between the artist’s body and the drawing surface, which is also embodied in Nick Mauss’s recent work Untitled. The light glaze painted on the porcelain may seem unintentional, but it is in fact a carefully arranged composition that is both intuitive and suggestive. These small-size works with a certain exploratory purpose are echoed in Seal, an early abstract ink work by Qiu Deshu in which he uses vermilion seal marks for the composition, freeing the viewer to imagine the connection between them."
