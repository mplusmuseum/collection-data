The superimposed red grid is a symbol for rationality and an allusion to a common method for reproducing and enlarging images. The painting caused major controversy when it first appeared because the presentation was a vast contrast to the traditional portrayal of political figures. Wang Guangyi belongs to the generation of artists who actively participated in the new wave movement during the 1980s; his worldview changed in response to a series of social changes beginning in 1989. His later paintings, which fuse American consumer brands and Chinese propaganda images, were the foundation for Political Pop during the 1990s."
