He went outside his usual preferred mediums of installation, painting, and video, to create this seemingly classical landscape that mocks arbitrary institutional standards. Its monumental size and horizontal composition is a contrast to the traditional handscroll in the literati context, where viewing is an intimate and personal act. His artistic practice is primarily concerned with the changing cityscape and contemporary issues stemming from globalisation."
