It belongs to a creative period when Chuang, a member of the Taiwanese modernist art group, Fifth Moon Society (1956–72) , made abstract paintings composed of blunt and deliberately uncalligraphic strokes in oil, acrylic, and ink, combined and layered with paper collage. He constructed forms and shapes foreign to Chinese painting in order to invent his own language of painting, consciously breaking away from his upbringing, which was immersed in traditional calligraphy and painting."
