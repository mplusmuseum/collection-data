Wang replaced these figures with bleeding penguins, an animal that has no significance in Chinese culture and is not native to the country. The absurdity of inserting these creatures into a loaded historical image, paired with the title of the work, can be seen as a sly response to China’s launch of a new identity in anticipation of global attention during the 2008 Olympics. Wang is known for embracing chaos and unsettlement in his practice. Though trained in the traditional socialist realism style, he employs a range of painting techniques and compositions to address contemporary social conditions and his personal history."
