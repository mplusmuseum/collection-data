Fang Lijun employs water to depict a carefree environment where there is no pressure; the repeated shaved heads are freedom from both individuality and social collectivism. For over two decades, these motifs defined his artistic practice, conveying the helplessness felt by the Chinese during the 1990s. They became a major facet of Chinese contemporary art. Fang is regarded as the pioneer of the Cynical Realism movement in early 1990s; he resorted to humour and cynicism to respond to the tumultuous social changes in China."
