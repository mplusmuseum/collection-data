The text began with the inscription on his forehead, which reads ‘Yu Gong Yi Shan’, a reference to the Chinese legend Yu Gong who had the mental power to move mountains. As the words accumulated—bearing stories and names of people he knew—ink obscured the artist’s skin and his face became unrecognisable. The work, combining calligraphy with the human body, can be read as the impact of personal and family stories upon an individual. Zhang is known for his performance works created in China during the 1990s. As a member of the Beijing East Village, he often documented his performances through photographs; these two mediums were central to the short-lived artist collective."
