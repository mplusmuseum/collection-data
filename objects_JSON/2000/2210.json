The appearance of the men indicates the changing social environment and economic status of China. While the laughing masks and their body language convey harmony, each man’s stiff, oversized hands betray anxiety and discontent. This painting is part of the Mask series, which Zeng Fanzhi began after he moved to Beijing in the early 1990s. He was astonished by the rapid urbanisation and economic development of the art capital and expressed this through depictions of city dwellers wearing identical stylised masks. Echoing the theme of disguise, he moved away from the expressionist brushwork of his earlier work, and instead used a palette knife to smooth the paint’s surface, hiding any lingering emotions."
