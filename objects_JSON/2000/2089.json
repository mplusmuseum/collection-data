In the end, he created around ten, but also wrote a manual with rules for reproducing the series. The mechanical approach and clinical subject challenge modernist ideas of art as self-expression. In 1986, Zhang and Geng Jianyi co-founded the artist group Pond Society, one of the earliest conceptual art collectives, in Hangzhou. The collective’s goal was to deliver art from an academic context into public space through Happenings, installations, and collaborative works."
