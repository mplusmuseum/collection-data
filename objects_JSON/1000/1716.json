Previously, in Hong Kong, he had studied with Lui Shou-kwan, who promoted the modernisation of ink painting, and had begun to import modern design principles such as geometric shapes and structures into his abstract ink paintings. His work during this period also repurposes his earlier lyrical ideals as a poet and conveys personal feelings through colour, structure, and texture. In this work, he channels his nostalgia through blue, symmetrical and rectangular areas painted with ink and acrylic, water-based materials of Chinese and Western origin, respectively, forming the distance created by the sea."
