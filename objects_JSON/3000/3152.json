The seemingly abstract pattern in this work is in fact Wang’s realist depiction of the tiled floors of his childhood home. He painted every pebble in detail, even sanding the surface of the canvas as one would do to polish an actual Terrazzo floor. The minimalist yet photographic quality and time-consuming approach probes the boundary between realism and abstraction. It also reflects the artist’s conscious investigation into western modernist art. Wang is best known for his meticulous process-based canvasses that examine time and the physical act of painting; his artistic style is unusual among artists of his generation."
