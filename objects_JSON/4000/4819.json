Between 1987 and 1988, he explored the middle ground between the figurative and the abstract with the thirty-painting series Another State of Man. The larger-than-life human forms, composed by broad strokes of twists and swirls in both conventional black ink and white acrylic paint (which Zheng calls ‘white ink’), show his interest in blending materials,enriching the surface texture,and pushing the boundaries of ink painting."
