                        "text": "Sopheap Pich’s return to Cambodia in 2002, after about twenty years in the United States, triggered a vital new direction in his art making, as he moved away from painting and began creating three-dimensional sculptures out of locally sourced bamboo and rattan. Working with local craftsmen, he devised a latticework method reminiscent of vernacular forms such as woven bamboo baskets and fish traps. Compound is unusual in Pich’s body of work in that it consists entirely of repeated geometric shapes as opposed to a single composition. It is also his first work to embrace a modular approach; the individual components can be endlessly rearranged and stacked in different configurations that change according to the display space. Following a conversation with the artist, M+ devised a special arrangement of the work for this exhibition, involving a portion of the total number of elements. Produced at a time when Pich’s home city of Phnom Penh was undergoing rapid urbanisation, the rectilinear forms of Compound serve as a poignant commentary on the constantly changing cityscape."
