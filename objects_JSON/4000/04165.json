Five men in the back row are leaning against the walls of the room, which are covered with posters, some with portraits of women visible on them. Two men are in the middle row, with the one on the left lying on the floor, leaning on another man who is seated in the back row, while the one on the right rests his elbow on a coffee table and holds a lit cigarette. There are two men in the front row; the one on the left has only his upper half shown and is lying down and reading a book, while the one on the right is leaning forward. Most of the men are dressed in Western clothing, and their gaze is directed to the right."
