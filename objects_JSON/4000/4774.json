In this work, the vertical and horizontal calligraphic strokes are perpendicular to one another, densely stacked in the lower centre of the composition and becoming loose toward the edges, as if carried by the wind. The strokes are made up of pigments mixed into glue, which allow the gestural traces and materials to become visible. Each brushstroke is a repetition of another, independent yet related."
